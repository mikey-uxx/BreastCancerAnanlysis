# Breast Cancer Ananlysis
A machine learning project focused on analyzing and predicting breast cancer using the Wisconsin dataset. This includes data preprocessing, visualization, and model building to classify tumors as benign or malignant.

Features :
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Feature correlation and selection
Multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Random Forest)
Model evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall)

Dataset :
UCI Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)

Objective :
To explore the dataset and build accurate prediction models for early breast cancer detection.
